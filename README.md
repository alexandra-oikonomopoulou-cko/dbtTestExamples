Welcome to the dbtTestExamples project!

### Using this test examples project
- This project has some simple dbt models along with related tests. Its purpose is to provide users with some quick examples of dbt schema and data tests. 
- This does require an installation of a local server which can be found in this project's documentation (WIP) 
- This also requires custom configuration in the profiles.yml file for dbt, which is also covered in [some dbt documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/profiles.yml/)

Try running the following commands:
- dbt debug
- dbt test
